# 🏢 Intelligent Office Layout Generator  
Optimized Furniture Placement Using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This project was heavily inspired from [PlanIT](https://github.com/brownvc/planit.git) and [Deep Convolutional Priors for Indoor Scene Synthesis](https://github.com/brownvc/deep-synth.git). Fully tested on macOS Sequoia 15.3.1. Also assumes CUDA is installed and a CUDA-compatible GPU is available. Requires Python >= 3.12.5 since some new features are used throught the codebase. 

## 📌 Overview  
The **Intelligent Office Layout Generator** is a **Python-based tool** that automatically arranges furniture (tables, chairs, windows, and doors) inside a room efficiently. It ensures **no overlaps**, maintains **proper accessibility**, and optimizes **space utilization** using **Graph Neural Networks (PyTorch Geometric)** and **NetworkX** for visualization. The tool supports **multiple furniture arrangements**, including **Line, Grid, and Circular placements**, allowing customization based on user preferences.
The code is provided as is, I could not run any further tests to ensure that it is working since I **no longer have access** to the dataset I used.

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ **Multiple Furniture Arrangement** – Choose from 'line', 'grid', or 'circular' placement options  
✔️ **No Overlaps** – Ensures proper spacing between tables, chairs, doors, and windows  
✔️ **Smart Chair-Table Connections** – Each table is connected to the nearest chairs automatically  
✔️ **Graph-Based Visualization** – Uses 'NetworkX' and 'Matplotlib'  
✔️ **Customizable Room Settings** – Modify room dimensions, furniture count, and more  

## 🛠️ Installation  
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  
`````bash 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/office-layout-generator.git 
cd office-layout-generator 
`````
### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**  
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. Then, install the required dependencies using:  
`````bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install torch torch-geometric matplotlib networkx
`````
### **▶️ Usage**
Run the script and select an arrangement type:
```bash
python office_layout.py
```
You will be prompted to choose an arrangement:
```bash
Choose furniture arrangement (line, grid, circular): grid
```
